You can, however, download the [zip ball](https://github.com/TalkStats/tsfortunes/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/TalkStats/tsfortunes/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **devtools** package to install the development version:

```r

update.packages()
## devtools is required
library(devtools)

```
